# Rescale!

**This is the most complete set of Sigma Dimensions configs available on the KSP forum.**

Due to so many people asking why other scaling "mods" don't work properly and for people that don't fully understand how to write their own cfgs, I decided to throw together some cfgs that I use in GPP, and tweaked them to work with stock and all planet packs. 

**_REQUIRES:_**
**KOPERNICUS AND SIGMA DIMENSIONS** 

**All configs work with:** 
* **Kerbalism** 
  * Automatically scales antenna ranges when **Kerbalism** and **Custom Barn** Kit is installed.
   

* **Environmental Visual Enhancements 1.2.2.1** and all visual packs
  * Automatically scales cloud height and detail tiling when a visual pack is installed.
   

* **Scatterer**
  * Automatically scales sun flares when scatterer is installed.
   

* **Kronometer**
  * Automatically changes format of in game date and time when kronometer is installed. 

* **All planet packs** _(will make planet pack specific changes upon request from pack devs)_
  * If the pack adds a new sun or renames the sun in stock, the name in the cfg will need to be changed to match or added to the cfg. 



**KNOWN ISSUES:**  
* Scatterer doesn't scale very well. :/ It works but you may see some artifacts that are kind of an eyesore. 



 **THE SIZES** 

**2.5x** - The optimal size for users who want a bigger system but still want to use stock parts. 

**3.2x** - About the same as 2.5x but a step up in difficulty. 

**6.4x** - A much larger rescale that may require you to rescale the stock parts via SMURFF or RO. Or don't. It's your life. 

**10x** - Roughly a true to life size rescale that will definitely require SMURFF or RO. 

**10.625x** - Closest to real life scale as you can get. Will need SMURFF or RO. 

  

**NOTE:** I highly recommend that you use **KRONOMETER** with these cfgs so that your in game clock and dates are correct.
